Here's a port of http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/harry/jotp/ to 
Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME), so that it can be used on 
mobile phones that supports Java. I made this so that I can securely 
connect to our ssh-server from insecure internet cafees, where 
people might be trying to sniff my passsword. The midlet supports 
md5-hashing, since that's what I'm using. Adding md4 should be 
trivial, if anybody needs it.

I use this with an openssh server configured with '--with-skey',
to securely log into my servers from unsecure terminals.

Building and testing in emulator
--------------------------------
This is the calculator
You will need the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit for CLDC, 
http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/overview.html
to build it from source. I install this in /usr/local/bin/WTK2.5.2, 
and set my PATH to include it:

	export PATH=/usr/local/WTK2.5.2/bin:$PATH

The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit also includes an emulator, so that
it's easy to test the application without uploading it to the phone.
Very handy for development. To test it in the emulator, download the
.jad and .jar and execute: 'emulator -Xdescriptor:jotp.jad', or 
simply "make demo".
